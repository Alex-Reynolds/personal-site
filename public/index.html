          <h1>Hi, I am Alex</h1>
          <p>
            I have a passion for technology, problem solving, and fitness. In my free time, I enjoy exercising or playing disc golf, chess, or video games with my friends.

            PS: I built this site in one night for fun as a way to experiment with shaders for the first time, so it's not designed to work well on mobile or with different page magnification levels (I may add that later).

            Despite not yet taking upperclassman courses in algorithms, I was still recruited to represent Iowa State University on the national stage for competitive programming. ICPC NAC was by far the most fun competition I have ever competed in. If it weren't for studying abroad and work requirements, I definitely would have competed again as an upperclassman with more skills :)
