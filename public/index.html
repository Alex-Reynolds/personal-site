          <h1>Hi, I am Alex</h1>
          <p>I have passion for technology, problem solving, and fitness. In my free time I enjoy exercise or playing disc golf, chess, 
            or video games with my friends.

          <p>PS. I built this site in one night for fun as a way to experiment with shaders for the first 
            time so things are not designed to work on mobile or with different page magnification levels (may add later)

            Despite not yet taking upper classman courses in algorithms, I was still recruited to represent Iowa State University on the national stage for competitive programming.
            ICPC NAC was by far the most fun competition I have ever competed in. If it weren't for studying abroad and work requirements I definitely would have competed again as an upper classman with more skills :)
